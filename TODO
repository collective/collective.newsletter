TODO
====

- write tests
- fix encoding problems (especially the subject field is encoded in the
moment as UTF8 which isn't understood by many clients)

- use z3 class directive instead of five:implements to add interface
56	   <class class="Products.ATContentTypes.content.image.ATImage">
57	       <implements interface="Products.slideshowfolder.interfaces.ISlideshowImage"/>
58	   </class>

DONE - use actions.xml instead of browser:menuitem?
DONE - use Products.statusmessages for portal status messages instead of
  portal_status_message in support.py
OK - since plone3 a plone site is a local site which can store local utilities.
  see p4a.common configure.zcml notes
  >>> from p4a.common import site
  >>> def setup_portal(portal):
  >>>     site.ensure_site(portal)
